 <font color="red"> <b> April 15 update: Rest of Spring Semester</b> <br> 
	 *** The details below could change for a number of reasons, but I thought it may be helpful to give everyone a general idea about the next few weeks. Please note that the gradebook essentially closes with the project/presentation on Week 9.*** <br>
	 
<strike> Week 6 Assignment: Due Sunday 4/18 </strike> <br>
<strike> Week 7 Assignment: Due Saturday 4/24 or Sunday 4/25 </strike><br>
<strike> Week 8 Assignment: Due Sunday 5/2 </strike><br>
AP Exam Date: May 4  <br>
Week 9 Project/Presentation: Sunday 5/9. Project description goes live on Tuesday of Week 9, after the AP exam.<br>
Week 10: ungraded activities.<br>
<br>

About the Project/Presentation: Typically after the AP exam students do NOT complete any graded work in AP Subjects. This year we will be completing one individual project/presentation during week 9 in AP Calculus. The project details will be published/assigned soon after the AP Exam on May 4th. In broad terms, for your work on the project you can expect to produce a video and audio presentation by the end of week 9.
</font>

<!-- 

<h2> Week 10: please see announcement for details. The presentations have all been factored into the current grade, which is also the spring semester grade. Good luck with the final exercises in your other subjects!</h2>

   <h2> Rest of week 9: we'll spend each class meeting to work on Projects/Presentations. </h2>

	 <h1> A note about the AP EXAM </h1> <br>
	 <h3>The AP Exam date is entirely your decision. Each student situation varies, so I am not going to recommend any particular date or format. As of now, my plan and hope for our class is to complete the AP curriculum by May 3, on time for the May 4th exam date. After May 4th the general plan is to explore non-AP level projects. Please direct any AP Registration questions to Dr. Willis. Thank you.  </h3> <br>

P1 (5 points) <br>
-states that g'(x) = f(x) by the fundamental theorem of calculus. <br>
- a) g'(x) = f(x) changes from positive to negative at x=1 and x=5, so g(x) has a local maximum there <br> 
-  g'(x) = f(x) changes from negative to positive at x=3 and x=7, so g(x) has a local minimum there <br>
- b) concludes that g(x) achieves an absolute maximum at x=9 with careful reasoning that uses the relative size of the net area contributions. <br>
- c) states that g''(x) = f'(x), so g(x) will have a concave down graph whenever f'(x) < 0. This occurs on (1/2, 2), (4, 6), and (8, 9). <br>
- d) offers a neat sketch that confirms the relationship with and properties of the original function.

- sets the two quantities equal to each other and solves for t = 26 sqrt(7/3) weeks <br> <br>


P4 ( 3 points) <br>
- takes the derivative of both sides, using FTC part 1, to get: f(x) / (x^2) = 1/sqrt(x) <br>
- solves for f(x) = x^(3/2) <br>

<i> General note: please let's get in the habit of writing the full name of the test used. For example, using the First Derivative Test for Global Extrema, I conclude that Q(...) = ... is a global minimum. Also, words like 'global' or 'absolute' should be used in all these problems. </i> <br>
P1 (5 points) <br>
-draws a graph of y = 1/(x^2 + 1) -- we have seen this graph before. <br>
-sets up Q(x) = f'(x) = (-2x) / (x^2 + 1)^2 and states the domain: all reals or limits the domain to (-infinity, 0) with reasoning <br>
-finds Q'(x) in its factored form = 2 (3x^2 - 1)/(x^2+1)^3 and identifies critical numbers: x = +- sqrt(3)/3 <br>
-states the y-coordinate: 3/4<br>
-Justifies that a global maximum is achieved @ x = -sqrt(3)/3 by using the First Derivative Test for Global Extrema or the Second Derivative Test for Global Extrema. <br>
** Important ** Please do not just draw a number line that reads - to + without a) explaining convincingly why the sign changes the way it does, and b) stating the name of the test you are using. If confused, please revisit the examples we solved in class. <br>
 <br><br>
 
P2 (5 points) <br>
-set up Q as distance squared and simplify it to: t^2 + (1-2t)^2 with domain [0, infinity) (the domain was given) <br>
-finds Q'(t) = 10t-4, sets it equal to zero or undefined, and identifies t=2/5 as the only critical number. <Br>
-justifies that a global minimum occurs at t=2/5 by using the First Derivative Test for Global Extrema or the Second Derivative Test for Global Extrema. <br> 
-Compute distance: d = sqrt(Q(2/5)) = sqrt(5)/5 units <br>
See my comment in Problem 1 about the justification. The sign of Q'(t) will depend on the linear expression 10t-4 which has a positive slope  and therefore cuts the horizontal axis from below to above at the critical number:  a sign change from negative to positive occurs.  Note that it would be a mistake to use the Closed Interval Method here.
 <br><br>

P3 (4 points) <br>
-neat drawing with variables shown <br>
-if x and y are the poster dimensions, write y = 180/x and Q(x) = (x-2) (180/x -3) to represent the print area<br>
-For the domain, please write 2 < x < 60. (Do not make it a closed interval.) <Br>
-Compute and factor Q'(x) = 3 (120 - x^2) / (x^2)<br>
-identify x = 2 sqrt(30) as the only critical number in the domain <br>
-compute y = 3 sqrt(30) <br>
-justify using the first derivative test for global extrema or the second derivative test for global extrema. (see my comment in problem 1, please, about the use of the tests.) 
 <br><br>

P4 (5 points) <br>
-offers neat drawing <br>
-sets up Q(theta) as the sum of two lengths, for example, version 1: Q(theta) = 9 sec(theta) + 6 csc(theta) or depending on which angle you set as theta, you could have version 2: Q(theta) = 9 csc(theta) + 6 sec(theta) <br>
-OR sets up Q(x) or Q(y), if you used x and y for the sides of the right triangle(s) <br>
-states the domain for theta is (0, pi/2) <br>
-working with version 2 of Q, finds Q'(theta), sets it equal to zero or undefined, to identify one critical number: theta* = arctan(cuberoot(3/2)) <br>
-evaluates the length as [3sqrt(2)/2]* [2+ cuberoot(18)]^(3/2) or variations of this quantity.<br>
-To justify a global minimum, we can use one of the derivative tests for global extrema. The second derivative test is a bit messy to write out. For the first derivative test for global extrema, note that ArcTan(cuberoot(3/2)) is between ArcTan(sqrt(3)/3) and ArcTan(sqrt(3)), so evaluate the derivative at these familiar places to confirm that the sign changes from - to +. <br>-note 1: (sqrt(3)/3) equals tan(pi/6) and sqrt(3) = tan(pi/3)<br>
-note 2: it would be nice to comment on how/why the global minimum for our function actually translates into a maximum pipe length in this situation.

-f'(x) = x (2 ln(2x)+1) in factored form, with critical number x=1/(2 sqrt(e)) and sign table. <br>
-f''(x) = 2 ln(2x) + 3, with critical number x = 1 / (2 e^[3/2]) and sign table<br>
-Please note: make sure the first row for each sign table starts with x=0 as the border (not negative infinity) <br>
-Extrema: global and local minimum at x = 1/(2 sqrt(e)), y = -1/(8e); no other extrema<br>
-Inflection point at: (1/(2 e^[3/2]), -3/(8e^3))<br>
-neat sketch that agrees with your sign analysis. <br>
-be sure to indicate an open circle at the origin and confirm, using L'Hospital's Rule, that the limit of f(x) as x goes to zero from the right is in fact 0. <br><br>

P2 (5 points)<br>
a)<br>
-Introduce a function f(t) = s1(t) - s2(t) where s1 and s2 represent the individual position functions. <br>
-Apply Rolle's Theorem on [0, t*], where t* is the time when the race ends, after stating continuity and differentiability of f(t) on this interval <br>
-Conclude that at least once in the given interval f'(t) must equal zero, which implies that s1'(t) - s2'(t) = 0 at least once, hence the runners are moving at the same instantaneous rate at least once. <br><br>
b)<br>
-If f(t) is the position function, apply MVT on [0, 1/12] after stating the condition. <br>
-Conclude, in words and numbers, that the inst. velocity must equal 48 mph at least once. <br><br>

P3 (5 points)<br>
-finds the speed function: w(t) = 200t/(t^2 + 12)^12 after taking the absolute value of the velocity function. <br>
-please note: we have to state that the absolute value of (-200 t) is 200 t since t is greater than or equal to zero. <br>
-finds w'(t) = 600 (4-t^2) / [](t^2 + 12)^3]<br>
-identifies t = -2 and t = 2 and considers t=2 as the only critical number due to the domain <br>
-justifies, using a table or by commenting on the sign of the expression 4-t^2, that w'(t) changes from positive to negative at t=2.<br>
-concludes that, since this type of sign change (positive to negative) only occurs once in the entire domain, it follows that w(t), the speed function, must have a local and absolute maximum at t=2.<br>
-states the speed at t=2, which is 25/16 feet/s (with units)<br><br>

P4 (6 points)<br>
-states velocity as a piecewise function: v = -sin t when 0 < t < 2pi and 0 when t > 2pi <br>
-identifies t=pi<br>
-note: please don't use equal signs for the domain at the spot where the pieces connect unless you do the verification that position is smooth there<br>

-finds v(t) = 4 (4-t^2) e^[](-t^2)/8], and identifies t = 2 only. Note that the domain, as stated in class, is nonnegative t values <br>
-if you construct a table, please don't include negative t values <br>
-finds a(t) = t (t^2 - 12) e^[(-t^2)/8] and identifies t = 2 sqrt(3) only, due to the limited domain.<br>
-sign chart with conclusions: SU on (2, 2sqrt(3)) and SD on (0, 2) and (2sqrt(3), infinity)<br>
-shows, using L'Hospital's Rule, that the particle approaches zero as t goes to infinity, so the schematic drawing should have arrows as well as an open circle at the origin.<br>

- c) sqrt(3) + pi/45 <br><br>

P2: ( 5 points) <br>
-for this problem please be careful not to confuse the adjacent side (as a length) with the x-coordinate (as a negative quantity). To make it easier, call the adjacement side m and set m = -x, so that it truly represents a length. Writing tan(theta) = sqrt(-x) / x is not correct. <br>

-differentiates implicitly with respect to time. <br>

-writes a complete and grammatically sentence <br> <br>

P3: ( 10 points) <br>

-c) infinity with work (hint: write x as ln(e^x)) <br>
-d) 0 with work (if you solved this without L'Hospital's, that's fine, but be sure to show your thinking by using arrows or explaining in words why you need to transform the expression.) <br>

<br>  

P4: ( 5 points) <br>

-normal line equation: y - 2 = 2 (x-1) or simplified version <br><br>


P2: (5 points) <br>
-shows the function to be differentiable at x=0 (please use one-sided derivative notation or limits)<br>
-shows that g'(2) does not exist (please use one-sided derivative notation or limits) <br>
-gives formula for g'(x) as a piecewise function with three cases:<br>
 g'(x) 2 if x < or = 0 <br>
 g'(x)= 2-2x if 0 < x < 2 <br>
 g'(x)= -1 if x > 2 <br><br>
 (Note: the equal option at x=0 in the piecewise definition could be on either branch but not on both ) <br>
-sketch both functions; be sure to clearly have open circles on the derivative function when x=2. <br><br>


P3: (4 points) <br>
-shows that f'(3) and f'(3) do not exist, either using the limit definition or one-sided derivatives. Please do not solve this without first writing the original function as a piecewise function WITHOUT absolute value signs. <br>
-gives a piecewise formula for f'(x):<br>
f'(x) = 2x if x < -3 <br>
f'(x)= -2x if -3 < x < 3 <br>
f'(x) = 2x if x > 3 <br>
-gives a neat sketch of f and f'. Be sure to, once again, clearly indicate open circles at when x = -3 and x=3 on the graph of f'(x). <br> <br>


P4: (4 points) <br>
-finds f'(x), sets equal to zero, and solves for x. <br>
-part a)  x= 2pi/3 + 2 k pi   or x = 4pi/3 + 2 k pi <br>
-part b)  x= 7pi/6 +2 k pi or x = 11pi/6 + 2 k pi <br><br>

P6: (4 points) <br>
-shows that h'(-2) and h'(1) do not exist. Writing h(x) as a piecewise function with NO absolute value signs is a good way to approach this problem. Use the one sided derivatives or limit definition to confirm that h'(-2) and h'(1) do not exist. (Saying that it's a corner just isn't enough.) <br>
-states h'(x) in a piecewise fashion: <br>
h'(x) = -2 if x < -2 <br>

<u>Assessment Notes (Maximum: 12 points)</u> <br>
<u> Group reminders: </u>
I took off at least 10% for any of these: did not include start and end time; did not include honor code; submitted work late. <br>
Please note that more points will be taken off if this continues. Most of you have been very good about following instructions so far! <br> <br>

P1 (3 points) <br>
- Finds dy/dx = 1 + (sec(x))^2 <br>
- Evaluates dy/dx at x=pi to get slope equals 2. <br>
- Finds the equation of the tangent line: y = 2x - pi <br><br>

P2 (4 points) <br>
-draws a careful picture with details<br>
-finds an equation relating theta and x:  x = 10 sin(theta)<br>
-finds dx/dtheta = 10 cos(theta)<br>
-evaluates dx/dtheta = 5 ft/rad (with correct units) <br><br>

P3 (4 points) <br>
Let (a, a/(a+1)) be the point(s) where such tangent line meets the curve. <br>
-finds f'(a) = 1/(a+1)^2<br>
-sets f'(a) from first step equal to the rise over run for the segment connecting (1, 2) to (a, a/(a+1))<br>
-solves for a and finds two solutions: a= -2-sqrt(3) and a=-2+sqrt(3)<br>
-finds the corresponding y-values to give the both coordinates of the points (-2-sqrt(3), (1+sqrt(3))/2) and (-2+sqrt(3), (1-sqrt(3))/2)<br>
Note 1: Please rationalize denominators. I did not take off points this time, but keep in mind for the future. <br>
Note 2: When setting up an equation of tangent line, please don't write y - y1 = f'(x) (x-x1) The slope part (f'(x)) needs to be EVALUATED, so you can write it as f'(x1). If you write f'(x), the equation is a curve and not a line.  <br><br>

P4 (1 point)<br>
R'(0) = 1 with quotient rule without simplifying. In other words plug in x=0 immediately after the first step of the quotient rule. If you tried to simplify, ... (finish this sentence yourself). <br><br>

P1: (4 points) <br><br>
a) <br>
f'(x)= 6x + 2 with work that uses the definition. <br>
f''(x) = 6 with work that uses the definition. <br>
b) <br>
f'(x)=3x^2-3 with work that uses the definition.<br>
f''(x)=6x with work that uses the definition.<br>
<br><br>

P2: (2 points) <br><br>
a=f(x)  b=f'(x)  and c=f''(x)<br>
Please chop the domain into subintervals and comment, in grammatically correct sentences, how the y-values of graph b, for example, correctly measure the slope of the tangent line on graph a. Comment on signs (positive,negative, zero) and magnitude. Do the same for the relationship between graphs b and c. Very important: some of you have previewed or taken calculus before. Do not (!) solve problems using content/concepts that we have not discussed in class this academic year. You will not earn any credit for attempts that involve other calculus methods and concepts. <br><br>

P3: (5 points) <br><br>
a)<br>
Neatly presented graph with labels. Be sure to start at the origin (0,0) and highlight the different steepness for the segments where the person runs faster (slope getting steeper, similar to the graph of y=x^2 in Q1)), walk (not too steep -- a segment is fine), at rest (horizontal segment), run (steeper than the walking segment), and the final segment is identical similar to the one on the time interval [3, 8]. <br>

b) <br>
Be sure to have open endpoints here, since the position graph will not be differentiable at the transition points. The slope for the segment when the person is walking is zero, so the graph should be on the x-axis with open circles at each endpoint. The commentary and explanation was appreciated and rewarded here.<br><br>

P4: (6 points) <br><br>
a)<br><br>
f'(x) = -1/(2sqrt(9-x)) using the definition(!)<br>

P5: (8 points) <br><br>

a) <br> 
The left sided derivative is -1. Show this with limits. <br>
The right sided derivative is 1. Show this with limits.<br>
b)<br>
Graph with labels. <br>
c)<br>
jump discontinuity @ x=0 (with explanation)<br>
infinite discontinuity @ x=5 (with explanation)<br>
d) <br>
The function is not differentiable @ x=0, x=4, and x=5. At x=0 and x=5 f(x) is not differentiable because f(x) is not continuous there. At x=4 the function is not differentiable because the one-sided derivatives are not equal to each other. <br><br>


 <br> <br>


<b> Assessment Notes - Week 6 (15 points maximum)</b> <br />
General notes: <br>
-Please read and follow instructions on cover page. Not including the start and end time for example, led to points being taken off. <br>
-Pay attention to units. <br>
-Be sure to follow the 3 decimal places rule or leave final answers as reduced fractions. <br> <br>

P1: (5 points) <br> <br>
a)<br>
   0.040 with quotient <br>
   0.220 with quotient <br>
   0.880 with quotient <br>
b)<br>
(f(2)-f(0))/(2-0) is the best estimate because the secant line has a slope that appears to be closest to the slope of the tangent line at x=1. <br>
(f(3)-f(1))/(3-1) is the worst estimate because the secant line has a slope that appears to be signficantly flatter when compared to the slope of the tangent line at x=1. <br>
Other notes: Be sure to use three decimal places. <br>


 
P2: (5 points)<br><br>
a)<br>
-uses definition <br>
-uses conjugate <br>
-answer <br>
f'(x) = -5/(2 sqrt(3-5x)) <br>
b)<br>
dom of f: (-infinity, 3/5] with reasoning <br>
dom of f': (-infiniy, 3/5) with reasoning <br>

P3: 5 points <br><br>

a) F'(1950) is approximately equal to 0.100 average children per woman per year<br>
b) F'(1965) is approximately equal to -0.110 average children per woman per year<br>
c) F'(1987) is approximately equal to 0.050 average children per woman per year<br>
Please note: three decimal places and units as well. <br>
b)
Meaning: At each instance above, for every additional year, F(t) changes by approximately the value of the derivative (measured in average number of children per woman per year). A negative value for the derivative, like in 1965, means that the rate went down by approximately 0.110 average children per woman from 1965 to 1966. <br>

c) Multiple comments were accepted here. Some the comments from the group were a bit too creative (and inaccurate) but I did not take off points. You are not expected to know US history and it's okay if you simply referred to the labels on the graph. <br><br>

<b> Notes on Assignment and Assessment from Week 5</b> <br />

<u>Assignment Notes (Each problem is worth 5 points) </u> <br>
 <b>Quick Group reminders</b>
 Please learn to scan into a pdf. A reminder was placed on myCushing.<br>
 Do not use a calculator when it is not allowed.<br>
 Do not justify work with concepts or techniques we have not learned/taught in this  class this year. <br><br>
 
P1: a) The first limit does not exist. Confirm by showing the one sided limits to be infinity and 0. <br>
    a) The second limit does not exist. One approach is to write u = 1/x and note that as x goes to 0 from the the positive side, u goes to infinity, and as x goes to 0 from the left, u goes to negative infinity. You can then argue by using the graph of f(u) = int(u) / u.<br>
	b) The limit exists for all real numbers (this sentence was edited on Oct 1). The function has removable discontinuities at all integers. Be sure to include a sketch here or show work in as much detail as possible. <br><br>
	
P2: a) 4, 0, 1<br>
b) 1, 0, DNE, DNE  (I gave credit if you wrote -infinity and infinity for the last two answers, as long as you explained your reasoning.) <br>
c) Continuous on intervals of the form (1/(n+1), 1/n) on (-1, 1), and also continuous for all c such that |c| < 1. Be sure to explain.<br>
 
P3: a) True with careful use of IVT on the given interval. Set up a single function that represent the difference between the position functions for each day. Be sure to comment on continuity.<br>
 b) Use the IVT on f(x) = x^3 + 1 - x on an appropriate interval. Be sure to point out why the function is continuous. <br>
<br>
P4: a) 0  b) infinity  c) infinity  d) -infinity  (show work for all parts)
    e) Sketch graph agreeing with the answers in the previous parts.
	<br><br>
P5: a) -3/4 (use conjugate)  b) (a-b)/2    c) infinity    d) infinity   e) -infinity.
 

 
 <br> <br>

<u>Assessment Notes (5 points for each problem)</u> <br>
P1: a) pi/2 with steps/explanation (start with e^x as x goes to infinity) <br>
P1: b) -1/2 with steps/explanation (divide both numerator and denominator by the nonzero quantity e^x; use limit notation with care) <br>
P1: c) 0 with steps/explanation (we can use the Squeeze Theorem here, as long as you explain carefully, or after rewriting argue that cos(x) oscillates on [-1,1] and is being divided by e^(2x), which goes to positive infinity, hence...) <br>

P2: Please do not just give a formula without explaining your reasoning. <br>
Multiple answers work here. One possibility is y = -(x-2) / ((x^2)(x-3)). Confirm each of the conditions algebraically.<br>

P3: Rewrite as f(x) = ln x - x - sqrt(x); Confirm that f(x) is continuous (with reasoninig) on the given interval; apply and refer to the Intermediate Value Theorem to conclude that the statement is True. <br><br>

<p>*** Feel free to use the notes/key below to go over your work. Please email me when you find mistakes in any answer key I share with you. Thank you. ***</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Problem 1: 6 points maximum</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>3 points for each part.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Most of us did well on this problem. Make sure you use open circles vs solid circles to indicate clearly whether or not a point is part of the graph. Additionally, be sure to label the axes and indicate your scale (units) and key points.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Problem 2: 4 points maximum</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Each limit, with units included, is 1 point.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Before the injection at t=12 the amount of drug in the bloodstream drops to 150mg (reaching it); immediately after the injection a spike in the total amount of drug in the bloodstream occurs, so the amount rises to just below 300mg, without reaching 300mg. (2 points)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Problem 3: 5 points maximum</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>3 points for part a)</p>
<p>We can use the conjugate here or the exponential form. For example, if we are comparing f(x) with f(-x), &nbsp;let&nbsp;</p>
<p>e^u = x + sqrt(x^2+1)</p>
<p>e^v = (-x)+sqrt(x^2+1)</p>
<p>Multiply side by side, and then proceed to show that u and v, the original y values for the given function, turn out to be opposites of each other.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>No matter your approach, explanations are expected, especially for crucial steps.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>2 points for b)</p>
<p>One version of the inverse is</p>
<p>g(x) = (e^(2x)-1)/(e^x)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Problem 4</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Neat sketch with details (3 points)</p>
<p>Answer: The limit exists for all real numbers except for a=pi (1 point)</p>
<p>Explanation: state the one sided limits as x approaches pi and confirm that they are not equal (1 point).</p>

<b> Week 2 Assignment Notes</b> <br />
<p>*** Feel free to use the notes/key below to go over your work. Please email me when you find mistakes in any answer key I share with you. Thank you. ***</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Problem 1</p>
<p>a) A horizontal shrink by a factor of 1/2 and a reflection over the x-axis occurs here. Your sketch, without a calculator should include at least one period.</p>
<p>b) The piecewise function consists of two pieces that connect at the origin. To the right of the origin the exponential function y = e^x has been shifted downward by 1 unit.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Problem 2</p>
<p>If we measure in cents, the daily payout option is 2^30 - 1 cents.</p>
<p>The monthly payout option of 1 million dollars is 10^8 cents.</p>
<p>To compare the two quantities, note that 2^10 = 1024 &gt; 1000 = 10^3</p>
<p>It follows that (2^10)^3 = 2^30 is greater than (10^9).</p>
<p>The daily payout is preferred if the goal is to earn more.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Problem 3</p>
<p>a) Yes, but justify with short proof. Examples are not proofs.</p>
<p>b) h is not necessarily odd (give an example)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;If f is odd, f(g(x)) will be odd (justify).</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;If f is even, f(g(x)) will be even (justify).</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Problem 4</p>
<p>f(x) = -3x (x+1) (x-2) or f(x)=-3x^3+3x^2+6x</p>
<p>with work</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Problem 5</p>
<p>a) f+g will be even (justify with short proof)</p>
<p>b) f+g will be odd (justify with short proof)</p>
<p>c) Neither / not necessarily (give an example)</p>
