 <font color="red"> <b> A note regarding myCushing grades:</b> The fall semester ends in February. The gradebook setup from the start of the year is making it difficult for the current grade to appear next to your name under progress. So, for now, please use the weekly updates to get your grade. (The 'fall_grade' label was placed there to help inform you. There are few other classes that do not have this.) Let me know if you have any questions. <br>  </font>

	 <font color="red"> <b> April 16 update: Rest of Spring Semester</b> <br> 
		 *** The details below could change for a number of reasons, but I thought it may be helpful to give everyone a general idea about the next few weeks. Please note that the gradebook essentially closes with the project/presentation on Week 9.*** <br>
	 
	<strike> Week 6 Assignment: Due Sunday 4/18 </strike> <br>
	<strike> Week 7 Assignment: Due Saturday 4/24 or Sunday 4/25 </strike><br>
	<strike>Week 8 Assignment: Due Sunday 5/2 </strike><br> <br>
	Week 9 Project/Presentation: Sunday 5/9. Project description goes live at our first class meeting on Week 9.<br>
	Week 10: ungraded activities.<br> <br>

	About the Project/Presentation: There is no final exam for this course because MVC is treated as an AP Subject in every aspect, even though there is no AP exam for it. At the start of week 9 you will be given instructions regarding a final project that will be completed by the end of the week. In broad terms, for your work on the project you can expect to produce a video and audio presentation that will be due on the Saturday or Sunday of that week. The gradebook will essentially close after this work. </font>

<!-- 
		<h2> Week 10: please see announcement for details. The presentations have all been factored into the current grade, which is also the spring semester grade. Good luck with the final exercises in your other subjects!</h2>

   <h2> Rest of week 9: we'll spend each class meeting to work on Projects/Presentations. </h2>

This problem set went very well. The only comments I have are:
-In problem 1, be sure to describe the condition x^3 + y^3 = 0 as y = - x on the coordinate plane. <br>
-In problem 2, although it's a bit of work please be patient with the numbers and do not use a calculator. If in doubt, ask or show attempted work with an explanation of where you stopped. <br>

P1: ( 9 points) <br>
a) <br>
-finds k(x) = x / (x^2+1)^(3/2) Since the domain is x > 0, this simplified version works. <br>
-finds k'(x) = (1-2x^2) / [(x^2+1)^(5/2)] <br>
-identifies (sqrt(2)/2, ln(sqrt(2)/2)) as a candidate <br>
-justifies a global maximum by showin that k'(x) changes sign from positive to negative just this one time. <br>
-as x goes to infinity, the curvature goes to 0 (justify) <br> <Br>
b) <br>
-finds k(x) = (e^x) / (1+e^(2x))^(3/2)  <br>
-finds k'(x) = (e^x) (1-2 e^(2x)) / [(1+e^(2x))^(5/2)] <br>
-identifies (ln(sqrt(2)/2), sqrt(2)/2) as a candidate <br>
-justifies a global maximum by showin that k'(x) changes sign from positive to negative just this one time. <br>
-as x goes to infinity, the curvature goes to 0 (justify) <br> <br>
-comment: I hope you noticed the connection between parts a) and b), graphically and numerically. <br> <br>
c) <br>
-starts with y= ax^2 + bx + c and concludes that c = 0 <br>
-finds k(x) = |2a| / (1 + [2ax+b]^2)^(3/2) <br>
-gives a specific example of an equation by making a choice on b, for example (b=0, 1, 2, etc.) <Br> <br>

P2: (4 points) <br>
-for part a) sets up arclength and finds sqrt(17) + (1/4) ln(sqrt(17) + 4) with work <br>
-for part b) finds k(t) = 2 / (1+4t^2)^(3/2) <Br>
-evaluates k(0) = 2, k(1)=2/(5^1.5), k(2) = 2/(17^1.5) <br>
-for part c), concludes that as t goes from 0 to 2, the curvature gets smaller. <br> <br>

P2: ( 8 points) <br>
False, False, True, False, True, False, False, False, with reasoning <br><br>

P4: ( 5 points) <br>
-notes that r'(t) is perpendicular to both r(t) and vector c <br>
-since r'(t) is perpendicular to r(t), that means the length of r(t) is constant, which means the position vector's tip will be on a sphere. <br>
-in order for r'(t) to be perpendicular to a given vector c, it means the path must be contained on a plane whose normal vector is a multiple of c. <br>
-therefore, the path of this particle is the intersection between a sphere and a plane. <br>
-a drawing and/or detailed description was expected here. as a general suggestion, not just on this problem: let's please work on the handwriting and grammar. <br> <br>

P5: (4 points) <br>
-after using FTC, sets up arclength and finds it to be  m units. <Br>
-finds curvature equal to |pi t|. Plugging in t = m, find k(m) = m pi (drop the absolute value if we assume m > 0) <br> <br>

P6: (3 points) <br>
-sets a multiple of the velocity vector equal to the vector connecting a point on the curve to the destination <br>
-for example, m * r'(t) = < 6, 4, 9 > - r(t) <br>
-solve the system to get t= 1 and m = 2 <br>
-writes conclusion <br> <br>

P7: (2 points) <br>
A: b is the original function and a is the curvature function, with reasoning. <br>
B: a is the original function and b is the curvature function, with reasoning. <br> <br>

P1 (5 points)<br> <br>
Solving the system of equations, we get 6x + 5y = 2, which represents a plane with normal vector < 6, 5, 0>. <br>
The intersection is a plane that is perpendcular to the xy-plane.<br> <br>

P2 (5 points) <br> <br>

c) (sqrt(101), pi/2, arctan(10)) <br> <br>

P5 (5 points) <br> <br>
I gave full credit for your attempts on parts a) through d). It was unfair to ask you to draw after saying in class I would not ask you to. In part e) I was curious about the inequalities: <br>

phi on [0, pi/4]<br>
rho on [0, cos(phi)]<br>
theta on [0, 2pi] <br><br>

P6 (2 points) <br> <br>
a) Show that y = r sin(theta) = a sin(theta) = a z, which describes a plane. An intersection of a plane and a cylinder yields an ellipse. <br>

Intersection point (-1/2, -9/4, 1/4) with work leading to your answer. <br> <br>

P2: (3 points) <br>
There are a couple of different ways to approach this, but it does involve a bit more work after stating the dot product requirement: <a, b, c> * <1, 1, 1> = 0 <br><br>
One equation of the wanted line is: <br
x = 1 + t<br>
y= -2 t <br>
z = 2+t <br>
This line is perpendicular to the given line, intersecting it at the point (1/3, 4/3, 4/3), and parallel to the given plane. (Note that you weren't expected to give this point.)

<b> Notes on the Assignment from Week 4 </b> <br>

Problem 1: 5 points <br>
a) v = <0, -5, -1> + a <1, 2, 1> with work <br>
b) no such vector v exists, with explanation <br> <br>

Problem 2: 2 points <br>
All the points P are on the plane containing points A, B, C. The reason for this is because the cross product is perpendicular to this plane, and for the vector AP to have a dot product of zero with the cross product, that implies P has to be part of the plane. <br>

Problem 3: 4 points <br>
There are several good approaches one can take here. One is to write c = -b - a, and then proceed by proving two different equalities. <br>

Problem 4: 2 points <br>
True and quick proof. Use the properties of the cross product to manipulate the left hand side. <br>

Problem 5: 2 points <br>
Hint: Write the left side as ( |u| |v| sin(theta)) ^2 and then use 1-(cos(theta))^2 = (sin(theta))^2. <br>

<b> Notes to the Assignment from week 3</b> <br>
	
Problem 1 <br>
Note that |a| b and |b| a have the same length. <br>
Set up the dot product each with vector c to show that the dot products are equal, and therefore the respective angles these two vectors form with c must be equal. <br>

Problem 2 <br>
I was hoping to see a nice drawing here. <br>
Let u = <x1, y1> the vector that connects the origin with the point. <br>
Define v = <b, -a>, the vector in the direction of the line. <br>
Take the scalar projection of u onto v. <br>
Find the distance from the tip of u to the tip of the orthogonal projection of u onto v. You can use the Pythagorean Theorem if you like. <br>
Add the distance from the previous step to the distance from the line to the origin. <br>
Be sure to take the absolute value when getting out of the square root. <br>

The evaluation is simple, 13/5.

<br> 
Problem 3 <br>
The center is the midpoint of the segment connecting the vectors and the radius is half the distance of this segment. <Br>
	
	Problem 4 <br>
	Set up the dot product and use the calculator to find the arccosine.

<b> Week 2 Assignment Notes</b> <br />
<p>*** Please email me when you find mistakes in any answer key I share with you. Thank you. ***</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Problem 1</p>
<p>a) With the aid of a drawing, stretch or shrink vectors a and b so that their sum, using the parallelogram rule, gives the vector c.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>b) For an algebraic argument, set up the equations:</p>
<p>a = &lt;a1, a2&gt;</p>
<p>b = &lt;b1, b2&gt;</p>
<p>c = &lt;c1, c2&gt;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Finding t and s amounts to solving the system of equations:</p>
<p>c1 = s a1 + t b1</p>
<p>c2 = s a2 + t b2</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Because the vectors are nonzero and not parallel, this system will have a unique solution.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Problem 2</p>
<p>Parts a through c, require drawing.</p>
<p>d) Set up the equations, similar to problem 1, to find s=9/7 and t=11/7.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Problem 3</p>
<p>After drawing neatly, write</p>
<p>c = a + AC</p>
<p>c = b - 2AC&nbsp;</p>
<p>Multiply the first equation by 2, add side by side, and then solve for c.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Problem 4</p>
<p>Let v = &lt;a , a, a&gt;</p>
<p>Determine that sqrt(3) a = 1, so that a = sqrt(3)/3 and then list the component form.</p>
